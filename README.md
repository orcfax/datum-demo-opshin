## Script background

The script allows a claimant to receive a small deposited fee from another
wallet provided the conditions of the smart contract are met.

The smart contract must check the following:

* an Orcfax price-feed datum was published by the real Oracle (this is true when
the UTxO contains a token created with the correct minting policy).
* the value of the a price on-chain has not exceeded set boundaries.
* a small token fee has been paid to collect a deposited value.

The latest published Orcfax datum must be identified off-chain then the
transaction must be created and submitted to a cardano node.

### Script status

The current iteration of this work does not attempt to simulate entirely
real-world conditions involving multiple wallets. Instead, using Cardano's
unique qualities every transaction happens between the same wallet. This
simplifies this demo work by allowing one wallet to be funded. The process
is repeatable over-and-over again with minimal depletion of funds allowing
developers to try things out more easily.

### The DApp contract example using the Datum

The smart contract is used to verify a small fee has been paid and that the
current price on-chain does not exceed a configured limit. The limit can be
easily configured so that developers can observe the different behaviors of
the smart contract.

## The wallets

A single payment address is used throughout the examples.

All the payment addresses are obtained by starting from the same seed phrase,
using different derivation paths.

Seed phrase example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

```text
penalty style orient dinner fabric gift genuine problem over february hybrid material pottery ensure pond annual icon pole dish decide embody able connect four
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

With the virtual environment (venv) setup (below) you can create a phrase with
the following script call:

```sh
python generate_mnemonic_phrase.py
```

> Note: If the script has already been run once and a Bip32 pass phrase file
> exists the command will output the phrase and the associated wallet addresses
> without overwriting anything. This can be helpful to remind yourself of the
> addresses that you're working with. (do not run the script in public on
> mainnet!)

### Funding wallets

Using `generate_mnemonic_phrase.py` to create a wallet address or see the
existing address value you can proceed to fund it.

#### Wallet funding

Given a preprod wallet, it can be funded from the Cardano [Faucet][faucet-1].
Directions on how to use this service can be found on the faucet website.

[faucet-1]: https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/

All the funds that are required for this demo will be contained in this
wallet. In total the wallet only needs about 75 ADA.

#### Funding amounts

The script `generate_mnemonic_phrase.py` will output addresses with feedback
as follows:

```text
payment addr (requires ⩾ 75 ADA): 'addr_test1qrc...e3'
```

We can see the wallets need to be funded as follows:

* Payment wallet: ⩾ 75 ADA, 1 UTxO.

## Installing and using the contracts

All the contracts are in distinct folders, arranged by the order in which they
will be used. The configuration for each smart contract is in the `config.py`
file, and the `library.py` contains a few functions and assigns a few variables
that are used by the other scripts.

To complete the steps, preferably install a new venv with the required packages.

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

> NB. from hereon out `python` can be called as an alias for `python3` although
> will work just fine.

Install the required modules:

```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements/local.txt
```

### The Example DApp contract using an Orcfax datum

#### tl;dr

The included `Makefile` provides a shortcut for running each of the commands
below. This helps with repeating the different steps.

In order, you will want to do the following:

```sh
make build-contract
make deploy-contract
make deposit-funds
make claim-funds
make undeploy-contract
```

The `deposit` and `claim` commands can be run as many times as you would like.
The `claim.py` script might, for example, be modified to edit the transaction
metadata to output something different. Run those with:

```sh
make deposit-funds
make claim-funds
```

> Note: with the added convenience, make sure to leave ~30-60 seconds between
> commands to make sure all the transactions have made it on-chain. Given any
> errors, just run the command again.
>
> additionally: if funds are deposited without being claimed, run
> `make refund-deposit` to claim that value back.

`make` can be run to view more information:

```text
build-contract                 Build the Oracle smart contract.
claim-funds                    Claim the deposited funds.
deploy-contract                Deploy the Oracle smart contract.
deposit-funds                  Deposit funds to be claimed.
help                           Print this help message.
lint-contract                  Lint the smart contract.
refund-deposit                 Refund deposited funds.
undeploy-contract              Un-deploy the Oracle smart contract.
```

##### Full DApp instructions

The DApp contract can be built by running:

```shell
opshin build spending contract.py
```

The contract can be deployed on-chain as a Script Output and referenced when
being used. This is done by running the `01.deploy.py` script:

```shell
python 01.deploy.py
```

The script output looks like this:

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

From the wallets that we have already funded, the contract owner or user
(the `client`) needs to deposit an amount of ADA (and tokens) to the contract
address. This will set the following parameters in the datum:

* who is the `owner` of the funds (who can claim them)
* what fee and to which address should be paid when claiming the funds

The funds can be deposited by running the `02.deposit.py` script:

```shell
python 02.deposit.py
```

The script will output some logging that may be useful in debugging if at all
necessary, e.g. the publisher address can be queried to ensure that it is funded
correctly, and the smart contract address to ensure that it is on-chain.

If this script is successful a transaction URL will be output and can be
explored on preprod cexplorer, for example: [here][cexplorer-1].

The appearance of cexplorer may vary, but it should still be possible to
explore the transaction.

It is recommended to look at the following:

* metadata, it will show information about the transaction and on-chain data
used to build this transaction.
* reference inputs, these can be followed back to the original datum used to
build and validate this transaction.

##### Cleaning up - reclaiming the deposit

The funds can be claimed back (refunded) and the smart contract removed from
on-chain. See "Resetting oracle DApp" [below](#resetting-dapp-state).

##### Resetting DApp state

To reset the state established by the scripts here, e.g. to help debugging and
script development, the minting and claim scripts need to reclaim their value
and be undeployed.

We work backwards to do this, working first from the oracle based DApp.

##### Resetting oracle DApp

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

1. if funds haven't been claimed using the claim script:

```sh
python refund.py
```

2. undeploy the script:

```sh
python 04.undeploy.py
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## For developers

Developing on this solution should be easy enough. Start by looking at the
smart contract and thinking about changing the circuit breaker value:

* [smart-contract](contract.py).

And then looking at the claim script to start modifying data being used
off-chain:

* [claim script](03.claim.py).

To start turning this into something simulating real-life, developers will want
to start looking at parameterizing the wallets used in these examples. They will
also want to look at making greater use of the data available to them in the
datum, as well as accessing additional reference inputs, perhaps feeding into
the script different circuit breaker values and other off-chain values.
